# 🔐 JWT Secret Generated and Configured

## ✅ **New JWT Secret Generated:**

```
JWT_SECRET="mUBBTFY4hICipnOH9uw3bNQnVw2axBe64zw9vKjr+0A="
```

## 🔧 **Environment Files Updated:**

### **apps/backend/.env**
```env
JWT_SECRET="mUBBTFY4hICipnOH9uw3bNQnVw2axBe64zw9vKjr+0A="

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Generated New JWT Secret** - Created a cryptographically secure JWT secret using OpenSSL
2. **Updated All Environment Files** - All services now use the same JWT secret
3. **Restarted All Services** - Killed old processes and restarted with new configuration
4. **Verified Token Generation** - Tested that JWT tokens are being generated correctly

## ✅ **Current Status:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 ✅ RUNNING
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅ RUNNING  
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:8080 ✅ RUNNING
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + chess_db ✅ CONNECTED
- **JWT Secret**: Consistent across all services ✅

## 🎮 **How to Test:**

1. **Clear your browser cache** for localhost
2. **Open a fresh browser window** and go to **http://localhost:5173**
3. **Login as guest** with any name
4. **Click "Play"** - you should now see proper game creation and opponent matching

### **🎯 Test with Two Players:**
1. **Player 1**: Open http://localhost:5173 in one browser
2. **Player 2**: Open http://localhost:5173 in another browser/incognito
3. Both players login as guests with different names
4. Both click "Play" - they should be matched together and the game should start!

## 🔍 **What Should Happen Now:**
- ✅ Play button creates games successfully
- ✅ Players are matched together
- ✅ Chess board loads properly
- ✅ Moves are synchronized between players
- ✅ No more "Wait opponent will join soon..." hanging
- ✅ No more JWT verification errors

## 🚀 **Ready to Play!**

**The JWT secret has been generated and all services are running with consistent configuration. The play button should now work perfectly!** ♟️

### **🔑 JWT Secret Details:**
- **Generated using**: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- **Length**: 44 characters (base64 encoded)
- **Security**: Cryptographically secure random bytes
- **Consistency**: Same secret across all services
